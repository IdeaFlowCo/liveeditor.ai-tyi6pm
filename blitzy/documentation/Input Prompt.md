I want to build a an AI interface to improve my writing. It should allow me to paste in a document and then have a sidebar where I can ask ChatGPT to make improvements like "Make it shorter" . Then it will show a list of suggested changes I can review and accept or reject in a "track changes" style UI.  I should also be able to put arbitrary prompts into a chat in the sidebar. 

I would like a UI more similar to Microsoft Word track changes for making and reviewing edits in line. 

It should be usable immediately from the landing page without logging in. It should also allow the user to create accounts and save their documents.
