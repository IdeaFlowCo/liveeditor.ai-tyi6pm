## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### System Overview

The AI writing enhancement interface follows a modern web application architecture with a clear separation between the presentation, application, and data layers. The architecture employs a client-heavy model with stateful frontend components connected to stateless backend services through RESTful APIs. This architecture was chosen to provide immediate user feedback while leveraging cloud-based AI services for advanced language processing.

Key architectural principles include:
- Clean separation between rich document editing (client) and AI processing (server)
- Stateless backend services for horizontal scalability
- Client-side state management for responsiveness and offline capability
- Event-driven communication between components
- Progressive enhancement for core functionality without login
- Secure document processing with privacy controls

The system boundaries encompass the browser-based frontend application, RESTful backend services, AI integration layer, and secure document storage. Major interfaces include the document editing UI, track changes interface, AI suggestion sidebar, and user account management screens.

#### Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Document Editor | Provides rich text editing with track changes capability | ProseMirror, React | Text differencing performance, rendering efficiency |
| AI Suggestion Service | Processes document content with LLM to generate improvements | OpenAI/ChatGPT API, Langchain | Token optimization, prompt engineering, context management |
| Sidebar Interface | Manages user interaction with AI including templates and chat | React, Redux state | Context preservation, real-time updates, input validation |
| User Management | Handles authentication, profiles, and session management | Auth service, JWT | Anonymous sessions, secure transitions, data privacy |
| Document Storage | Manages persistent storage and retrieval of documents | MongoDB, Redis | Versioning, conflict resolution, access control |
| Track Changes Engine | Compares original and modified text to display differences | Diff libraries, ProseMirror | Large document performance, accuracy of change detection |

#### Data Flow Description

The primary data flow begins when a user inputs a document through pasting, typing, or uploading. This document is processed and normalized in the client's Document Editor component, which maintains the current document state. When the user requests improvements through the Sidebar Interface (either via templates or custom prompts), a structured request containing the document content, selected text (if applicable), and improvement directives is sent to the AI Suggestion Service.

The AI Suggestion Service transforms this request into an optimized prompt for the language model, preserving necessary context while managing token limits. The service communicates with external AI providers through secure API calls and receives improvement suggestions in return. These suggestions are then processed into a structured format compatible with the Track Changes Engine.

The Track Changes Engine applies a differencing algorithm to identify specific changes between the original and AI-suggested content. These differences are presented to the user as inline suggestions that can be individually reviewed. User decisions (accept/reject) are captured by the Document Editor and immediately reflected in the document state.

For authenticated users, document states and versions are periodically synchronized with the Document Storage service, which maintains persistent records. Anonymous users' documents are preserved only in browser session storage with appropriate warnings about potential data loss.

#### External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| OpenAI API | Service API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JSON | Response time < 5s, 99.9% availability |
| Authentication Service | Service API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JWT | Response time < 1s, 99.99% availability |
| Object Storage | Data Persistence | CRUD Operations | HTTPS/JSON | Response time < 2s, 99.95% availability |
| Analytics Service | Data Reporting | Event Streaming | HTTPS/JSON | Best effort delivery, non-blocking |

### TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Application Architecture | Single Page Application | Server-rendered, Hybrid | Provides best user experience for document editing with minimal latency after initial load |
| Backend Architecture | Modular Monolith with Service Boundaries | Microservices, Pure Monolith | Balances development velocity with service isolation while avoiding distributed system complexity for initial release |
| State Management | Client-heavy with Server Synchronization | Server-side State, Shared State | Enables offline-capable editing and immediate feedback while preserving data with server sync |
| AI Integration | Asynchronous Request-Response with Streaming Option | Synchronous Calls, WebSocket | Accommodates variable LLM response times while allowing progressive rendering of suggestions for large documents |

The architecture balances several competing concerns. The client-heavy approach with rich document editing capabilities provides the responsiveness needed for a word processor-like experience. The separation between editing and AI suggestion services allows for scalability where needed most (the computationally intensive AI operations) while keeping the user interface responsive.

The modular monolith approach for the backend services simplifies initial development and deployment while establishing clear service boundaries that could be separated into microservices if future scaling requires it. This approach avoids the complexity of distributed systems during initial development while preserving a path to scaling.

```

#### Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Selected Solution | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| User Documents | MongoDB | PostgreSQL, S3 + Metadata DB | Document-oriented storage provides flexibility for varying document structures and metadata |
| User Profiles | MongoDB | PostgreSQL, DynamoDB | Consistency with document storage simplifies development and deployment |
| Session Data | Redis | In-memory, JWT-only | Fast access for frequent session operations with appropriate expiration handling |
| Application Logs | Structured Logging to CloudWatch | ELK Stack, Custom Solution | Managed service reduces operational burden while providing necessary analysis capabilities |

The document-oriented approach with MongoDB was selected as the primary data store due to the variable structure of documents and associated metadata. This provides flexibility for future enhancements without schema migrations. Redis complements this as a fast session store and caching layer for frequently accessed data.

For anonymous sessions, we use a combination of browser storage and server-side session data with appropriate TTLs. This balances immediate usability with reasonable resource usage. The JWT approach for authentication enables stateless authentication verification while Redis provides a central store for session invalidation when needed.

#### Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
|------------|----------------|---------|----------------------|
| Document Cache | Browser IndexedDB + Memory | Immediate access to recent documents | Time-based expiration, explicit clear |
| Session Cache | Redis | Fast authentication and session checks | TTL-based expiration, explicit logout |
| AI Response Cache | Redis | Reduce duplicate AI requests | Time-based with content hash keys |
| UI Component Cache | React Memo + Custom Hooks | Prevent expensive re-renders | Dependency-based invalidation |

Caching is critical for both performance and cost optimization with external AI services. Browser-side caching through IndexedDB provides offline capabilities and fast loading of recent documents. Server-side caching in Redis prevents redundant AI processing for similar requests, reducing both latency and API costs.

The document editor uses memory caching with strategic persistence to maintain editing performance while protecting against data loss. Careful cache invalidation strategies prevent stale data while maximizing cache hit rates.

#### Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Concern | Selected Mechanism | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Authentication | JWT with Short Expiry + Refresh | Session Cookies, OAuth-only | Balances statelessness for scaling with security and revocation capabilities |
| Authorization | Role-based Access Control | Attribute-based, Capability-based | Simpler implementation for initial requirements with clear permission model |
| Data Protection | TLS + Field-level Encryption for Sensitive Data | End-to-end Encryption, Full DB Encryption | Appropriate security level without excessive performance impact |
| AI Prompt Injection Prevention | Input Validation + Prompt Templates | LLM Guardrails Only, Manual Review | Defense in depth approach protects against various injection techniques |

Security mechanisms were selected based on the sensitive nature of user documents while balancing performance and usability requirements. TLS provides transport security while field-level encryption protects the most sensitive data at rest. JWT authentication enables stateless verification with the ability to revoke access when needed.

Special attention was given to AI prompt injection prevention due to the potential for data leakage or manipulation. A combination of input validation, template-based prompts, and LLM guardrails provides defense in depth against such attacks.

### CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### Monitoring and Observability Approach

The system implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy focusing on both user experience and system health. Key metrics are collected at multiple levels:

- **Frontend Monitoring:**
  - Page load and interaction timings
  - Error rates and types
  - Feature usage patterns
  - AI suggestion acceptance rates

- **Backend Monitoring:**
  - API response times and error rates
  - AI service latency and token usage
  - Database performance and query patterns
  - Authentication success/failure rates

- **Infrastructure Monitoring:**
  - Server resource utilization
  - Network performance and availability
  - Service health checks
  - Deployment status and history

Observability is implemented through distributed tracing with correlation IDs flowing through all system components. This enables end-to-end visibility of request flows, particularly for AI processing operations which may involve multiple services.

Alert thresholds are configured for critical paths with escalation procedures defined for different severity levels. A dashboard provides real-time visibility into system health and usage patterns.

#### Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Category | Content | Retention | Access Control |
|--------------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Application Logs | Service operations, errors, warnings | 30 days | Developers, Operations |
| Security Logs | Authentication events, access patterns | 90 days | Security Team |
| User Activity Logs | Feature usage, document operations | 14 days | Product Team |
| Performance Traces | Timing data, resource usage | 7 days | Developers, Operations |

Logs are structured in JSON format with consistent fields across services. Each log entry includes:
- Timestamp with millisecond precision
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- Component and function identifier
- Event type and severity
- Anonymized user context when relevant
- Structured data relevant to the event

Personal or sensitive information is explicitly excluded from logs, with masking for any potentially identifying data. Logs are centralized in CloudWatch with appropriate IAM controls limiting access based on role and need.

#### Error Handling Patterns

The system implements a multi-layered approach to error handling:

- **User-Facing Errors:**
  - Friendly error messages with actionable guidance
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes for API errors
  - Automatic retry for transient failures when applicable
  - Graceful degradation of features when services are unavailable

- **Internal Error Management:**
  - Circuit breakers for external dependencies
  - Retry with exponential backoff for recoverable errors
  - Fallback strategies for critical functions
  - Dead letter queues for failed background operations

- **Error Reporting:**
  - Real-time error alerts for critical failures
  - Error aggregation and trending
  - Automated correlation with recent changes
  - User feedback collection on error encounters

    I --> S[Log Details]
    L --> S
    O --> S
    Q --> S
    R --> S
    
    S --> T[Report to Monitoring]
```

#### Authentication and Authorization Framework

The system implements a layered authentication and authorization framework:

- **Anonymous Access:**
  - Immediate usability without login requirement
  - Session-based state management with browser storage
  - Clear indication of limited persistence
  - Seamless transition to authenticated state

- **User Authentication:**
  - Email/password with strong password requirements
  - Optional OAuth integration for social login
  - JWT-based access tokens with short lifetime
  - Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
  - Multi-factor authentication option for sensitive operations

- **Authorization Model:**
  - Role-based access control for administrative functions
  - Document-level permissions for shared content
  - Feature access based on user tier/subscription
  - API rate limiting differentiated by user type

- **Security Measures:**
  - CSRF protection for authenticated requests
  - XSS prevention through content sanitization
  - Rate limiting for authentication attempts
  - Session termination capabilities for security events

#### Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Component | Performance Metric | Target | Degraded | Critical |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Page Load | Time to Interactive | < 2s | 2-5s | > 5s |
| Document Editor | Input Latency | < 50ms | 50-200ms | > 200ms |

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### SERVICE COMPONENTS

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibilities | Key Dependencies |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Document Service | Document processing, track changes management, editing operations | AI Service, Storage Service |
| AI Service | ChatGPT integration, prompt handling, suggestion generation | OpenAI API |
| User Service | Authentication, profiles, anonymous/registered session management | Storage Service |
| Storage Service | Document persistence, user data management, caching | Database Systems |

The architecture employs a modular monolith approach with clear service boundaries that could be separated into microservices if future scaling requires it. This approach balances development velocity with service isolation while avoiding distributed system complexity for the initial release.

#### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Client Browser] --> DS[Document Service]
    Client --> US[User Service]
    DS <--> AS[AI Service]
    DS <--> SS[Storage Service]
    US <--> SS
    AS --> ExtAI[External AI API]
    
    classDef service fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef external fill:#bbf,stroke:#33c,stroke-width:2px;
    
    class DS,AS,US,SS service;
    class ExtAI,Client external;
```

| Communication Path | Pattern | Protocol | Characteristics |
|-------------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Client → Services | Request-Response | HTTP/REST | Stateless, JSON payloads |
| Document ↔ AI | Request-Response | Internal API | Asynchronous with callbacks |
| Services ↔ Storage | CRUD Operations | Internal API | Transaction support |
| AI → External API | Request-Response | HTTPS/REST | Rate-limited, token-based |

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

For the initial deployment, service discovery utilizes environment-based configuration since services are deployed as a modular monolith. As the system grows, this can evolve to DNS-based discovery.

Load balancing strategy employs a simple round-robin approach for the API layer through AWS Application Load Balancer. The AI Service implements request queuing to manage high-demand periods and prevent overwhelming the OpenAI API dependency.

#### Circuit Breaker Patterns

Circuit breakers are implemented for external dependencies to prevent cascading failures:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure occurs
```

| Service | Protected Dependencies | Failure Threshold | Recovery Strategy |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AI Service | OpenAI API | 5 failures / 30 sec | Fallback to simplified suggestions |
| Storage Service | Database | 3 failures / 10 sec | Read from cache, queue writes |
| User Service | Auth Provider | 3 failures / 30 sec | Extend token validity, retry authentication |

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

The system implements retry strategies with exponential backoff for transient failures in external service calls:

| Service | Retry Pattern | Fallback Mechanism |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| AI Service | 3 retries, exponential backoff | Use simplified rule-based suggestions |
| Storage Service | 2 retries, 1s delay | Use browser storage temporarily |
| Document Service | No retry (user-facing) | Preserve local state and notify user |

### SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Scaling Approach

```

| Service | Scaling Type | Scaling Strategy | Resource Constraints |
|---------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Document Service | Horizontal | Scale with user load | Memory-bound |
| AI Service | Horizontal | Independent scaling based on request queue | CPU and API-quota bound |
| User Service | Horizontal | Scale with authentication request volume | Connection-bound |
| Storage Service | Vertical + Replicas | Scale up DB + read replicas | I/O bound |

#### Auto-Scaling Triggers and Rules

| Service | Primary Metric | Scale Out Threshold | Scale In Threshold | Cooldown Period |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| API Layer | CPU Utilization | 70% for 3 minutes | 30% for 10 minutes | 3 minutes |
| AI Service | Request Queue Length | >100 requests for 2 minutes | <10 requests for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Database | Storage/IOPS | 80% utilization | N/A (manual scale down) | N/A |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Component | Optimization Technique | Expected Benefit |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| Client App | Code splitting and lazy loading | 40% faster initial load |
| Document Editor | Virtualization for large documents | Support for documents 5x larger |
| AI Service | Request batching and caching | 30% higher throughput |
| Storage | Read replicas and query optimization | 50% reduced read latency |

        E4 -->|No| E3
        E5 --> E6[Resume Online Operation]
    end
```

#### Data Redundancy Approach

| Data Type | Redundancy Strategy | Recovery Point Objective (RPO) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| User Data | Multi-AZ database, point-in-time backups | 5 minutes |
| Documents | Client-side autosave + server backups | 30 seconds |
| Application Logs | Multi-region log aggregation | 1 minute |

#### Service Degradation Policies

| Resource Constraint | Degradation Response | User Impact |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------|
| AI Service Overload | Limit suggestion requests, increase response time | Longer wait times for suggestions |
| Database High Load | Read from cache, defer non-critical writes | Slight delay in saving changes |
| Memory Pressure | Reduce document cache size, increase garbage collection | Slower performance with very large documents |
| API Rate Limiting | Queue requests, provide estimated wait time | Transparent waiting UI for users |

#### Failover Configurations

| Component | Failover Trigger | Failover Action | Recovery Action |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Database | Primary instance failure | Automatic promotion of read replica | Rebuild new replica |
| Application Server | Instance health check failure | Route traffic to healthy instances | Replace unhealthy instance |
| AI Service | Service unresponsive | Route to backup service pool | Restart and rejoin primary pool |

The system implements progressive degradation during resource constraints or failures, maintaining core editing functionality even when AI features are limited. This approach ensures users can continue working with their documents even if enhancement features are temporarily unavailable.

For anonymous users, the system maintains client-side storage with periodic reminders about the benefits of creating an account for enhanced data protection. This balances immediate usability with appropriate safeguards.

The resilience patterns are designed to be transparent to end-users whenever possible, with clear status indicators and appropriate messaging when service capabilities are impacted by infrastructure events.

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

### SCHEMA DESIGN

#### Entity Relationships

The database design employs a document-oriented approach using MongoDB to support flexible document structures and efficient retrieval patterns for the writing enhancement system.

    }
    
    DOCUMENT_VERSIONS {
        ObjectId _id PK
        ObjectId documentId FK
        integer versionNumber
        text content

        ObjectId createdBy FK
        string changeDescription
        ObjectId previousVersionId
    }
    
    USER_PREFERENCES {

        ObjectId userId FK,UK
        string theme
        integer fontSize
        array defaultPromptCategories
        object notificationSettings
        object privacySettings
    }
    
    AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATES {
        ObjectId _id PK
        string name
        string description
        string promptText
        string category
        boolean isSystem
        datetime createdAt
        ObjectId createdBy FK
    }
    
    AI_INTERACTIONS {
        ObjectId _id PK
        ObjectId userId FK
        ObjectId documentId FK
        string sessionId
        ObjectId promptTemplateId FK
        string customPrompt
        text aiResponse
        datetime timestamp
        integer acceptedSuggestions
        integer rejectedSuggestions
    }
```

#### Data Models and Structures

| Collection | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Users | Stores user account information | email, passwordHash, accountStatus |
| Documents | Manages document metadata | userId, title, tags, currentVersionId |
| DocumentVersions | Stores document content versions | documentId, versionNumber, content, changeDescription |
| UserPreferences | Contains user settings | userId, theme, fontSize, privacySettings |
| AIPromptTemplates | Predefined improvement prompts | name, promptText, category, isSystem |
| AIInteractions | Logs AI suggestion sessions | userId/sessionId, documentId, promptTemplateId, aiResponse |

**Anonymous User Handling:**
For anonymous users, the system uses browser-based session IDs to track document ownership temporarily. Anonymous documents are stored in the same collections but with null userId fields and an associated sessionId.

#### Indexing Strategy

| Collection | Index | Type | Purpose |
|------------|-------|------|---------|
| Users | email | Unique | Fast lookup during authentication |
| Users | accountStatus | Standard | Filter active/inactive accounts |
| Documents | userId | Standard | Retrieve user's documents |
| Documents | tags | Multikey | Support tag-based filtering |
| Documents | (userId, isArchived) | Compound | Efficiently retrieve active documents |
| DocumentVersions | documentId | Standard | Retrieve document versions |
| DocumentVersions | (documentId, versionNumber) | Compound | Retrieve specific version |
| AIInteractions | sessionId | Standard | Track anonymous interactions |
| AIInteractions | (documentId, timestamp) | Compound | Document interaction history |
| AIPromptTemplates | category | Standard | Filter templates by category |

#### Partitioning Approach

The database employs selective sharding for scalability:

| Collection | Partitioning Strategy | Shard Key | Rationale |
|------------|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Users | No sharding | N/A | Relatively small collection size |
| Documents | Range-based sharding | userId | Even distribution of user documents |
| DocumentVersions | Hashed sharding | documentId | Distribute versions across shards |
| AIInteractions | Time-based sharding | timestamp | Efficiently handle time-series data |

#### Replication Configuration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Data Center"
        P[Primary Node] -->|Sync| S1[Secondary Node 1]
        P -->|Sync| S2[Secondary Node 2]
    end
    
    subgraph "Disaster Recovery Site"
        P -->|Async| DR[DR Secondary]
    end
    
    subgraph "Read Operations"
        APP[Application] -->|Writes| P
        APP -->|Primary Reads| P
        APP -->|Secondary Reads| S1
        APP -->|Secondary Reads| S2
    end
    
    subgraph "Backup Operations"
        S2 -->|Daily Backup| BK[Backup Storage]
    end
```

The system uses MongoDB replica sets with:
- 1 Primary node handling all write operations
- 2+ Secondary nodes for read operations and high availability
- Asynchronous replication to disaster recovery site
- Read preference configuration to distribute read load

#### Backup Architecture

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Full Backup | Daily | 30 days | Encrypted cloud storage |
| Incremental Backup | 6 hours | 7 days | Encrypted cloud storage |
| Oplog Backup | Continuous | 72 hours | Local + replicated storage |
| Point-in-time Recovery | Available | Up to 7 days | Generated on demand |

### DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

The system implements a controlled migration approach:

1. Schema versioning in a dedicated collection tracks database schema state
2. Migrations execute through a dedicated management tool with:
   - Pre-migration validation
   - Ability to apply incremental changes
   - Automatic rollback for failed migrations
   - Developer-defined up/down scripts

For larger schema changes, the system uses:
- Blue-green deployment approach
- Shadow writes during transition periods
- Gradual cutover to minimize impact

#### Versioning Strategy

Document versioning follows these principles:

| Version Type | Creation Trigger | Retention Policy |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Major Version | Explicit user save | Indefinite |
| Minor Version | Auto-save (5 min) | 24 hours |
| AI Suggestion | Each AI improvement | Until accepted/rejected |

The versioning system implements:
- Linear version history with incrementing numbers
- Metadata tracking for version provenance 
- Efficient storage using differential compression
- Version comparison and restoration capabilities

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Archival Trigger | Storage Location | Retention |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Active Documents | N/A | Primary database | Indefinite |
| Inactive Documents | 90 days without access | Archive storage | 1 year |
| Deleted Documents | User deletion | Soft-deleted state | 30 days |
| Anonymous Documents | Session expiration | Marked for cleanup | 7 days |

The system implements a tiered storage approach where archived content moves to lower-cost storage while maintaining searchability and recovery options.

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client Request] --> B{Cache Hit?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Return Cached Data]
    B -->|No| D{Document Type}
    D -->|Active| E[Primary Database]
    D -->|Archived| F[Archive Storage]
    E --> G[Process Result]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Update Cache]
    H --> I[Return to Client]
    
    subgraph "Storage Layers"
        E
        F
        J[In-Memory Cache]
    end
```

The system employs multiple storage mechanisms:
- MongoDB for document metadata and active content
- S3-compatible object storage for archived documents and backups
- Redis for caching and session management

#### Caching Policies

| Data Type | Cache Location | TTL | Invalidation Trigger |
|-----------|----------------|-----|----------------------|
| Document Metadata | Redis | 5 minutes | Document update |
| User Profiles | Redis | 15 minutes | Profile change |
| Active Document Content | In-memory application | Session duration | Content edit |
| AI Templates | Redis | 60 minutes | Template update |
| Common AI Responses | Redis | 30 minutes | Time-based only |

### COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Deletion Process |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| User Accounts | Until deletion + 30 days | Soft delete, then anonymize |
| User Documents | Until deletion + 30 days | Soft delete, then purge |
| Anonymous Documents | 7 days from last access | Automatic purge |
| AI Interaction Logs | 90 days | Anonymize after 30 days |
| Authentication Logs | 1 year | Automated archival |

The system implements configurable retention policies that can be adjusted to comply with regional requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

| Policy Type | Implementation | SLA Target |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Recovery Time Objective | 1 hour for critical data | 99.9% compliance |
| Recovery Point Objective | 5 minutes maximum data loss | 99.9% compliance |
| Backup Verification | Weekly automated restoration tests | 100% verification |
| Replica Redundancy | Minimum 3 nodes in replica set | N+1 redundancy |

Fault tolerance is implemented through:
- Automatic failover for database primary
- Geographic distribution of replicas
- Periodic recovery testing
- Incremental backup with point-in-time recovery

#### Privacy Controls

| Privacy Aspect | Implementation | User Control |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Document Content | Encrypted at rest | Full control |
| User Data | Field-level encryption for PII | Exportable/deletable |
| Anonymous Usage | No PII collection | Clear session expiry |
| AI Processing | Temporary processing only | Opt-out available |
| Analytics | Aggregated and anonymized | Configurable |

The system implements privacy by design principles with:
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Storage limitation
- User transparency and control

#### Audit Mechanisms

| Audit Type | Data Captured | Retention |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Authentication | Login attempts, IP, device | 1 year |
| Document Access | Read/write operations, user, timestamp | 90 days |
| AI Interactions | Prompt type, response type (not content) | 90 days |
| Admin Actions | All administrative operations | 1 year |

Audit logs are:
- Stored in a separate secure collection
- Immutable and append-only
- Accessible only to authorized personnel
- Regularly backed up and archived

#### Access Controls

| Access Level | Permissions | Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Anonymous User | Create/edit ephemeral documents | Session-based access |
| Authenticated User | Manage own documents | Role-based access control |
| Editor | Shared document access | Document-level permissions |
| Administrator | System management | Role-based access control |

Database-level controls include:
- Principle of least privilege
- Service account separation
- Database user segregation by function
- Role-based access to collections

### PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Query Type | Optimization Technique | Expected Benefit |
|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Document Retrieval | Covered queries using indexes | 80% reduction in query time |
| User Document List | Compound indexes with sorting fields | Efficient pagination and sorting |
| Text Search | Text indexes with weights | Fast full-text search |
| Version History | Projection to limit returned fields | Reduced network transfer |

The system implements:
- Query analysis and optimization
- Explain plan evaluation
- Index usage monitoring
- Selective denormalization for performance

#### Caching Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Application Cache]
    B -->|Miss| C[Distributed Cache]
    C -->|Miss| D[Database]
    D --> E[Result Processing]
    E -->|Update| C
    E -->|Update| B
    E --> F[Response to Client]
    
    subgraph "Cache Invalidation"
        G[Document Update] -->|Invalidate| B
        G -->|Invalidate| C
        H[User Action] -->|Selective Invalidate| B
    end
```

The caching implementation uses:
- Browser storage for anonymous session data
- Redis for shared application cache
- Tiered invalidation strategy
- Cache warming for frequent access patterns

#### Connection Pooling

| Pool Type | Size Strategy | Timeout | Health Check |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Write Connections | Fixed (instances × 5) | 30 seconds | 15-second interval |
| Read Connections | Dynamic (5-20 per instance) | 60 seconds | 30-second interval |
| Analytics Connections | Isolated pool | 120 seconds | On demand |

The system implements:
- Separate pools for read/write operations
- Connection distribution across replicas
- Automatic recovery from connection failures
- Connection lifecycle management

#### Read/Write Splitting

| Operation Type | Destination | Consistency Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Document Writes | Primary node | Majority write concern |
| Document Reads | Secondary preferred | Local read concern |
| User Profile | Primary preferred | Majority read concern |
| Analytics Queries | Secondary only | Available read concern |

Read/write splitting is implemented through:
- MongoDB read preference configuration
- Application-level routing logic
- Operation criticality assessment
- Consistency requirements by operation type

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process Type | Implementation | Scheduling |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Document Versioning | Bulk operations | On-demand |
| Anonymous Cleanup | Background task | Daily |
| Analytics Aggregation | Map-reduce jobs | Hourly |
| Index Maintenance | Scheduled operations | Weekly off-peak |

Batch processing uses:
- Chunked processing for large operations
- Progressive result handling
- Resource throttling to prevent impact
- Monitoring and alerting on batch job status

The database design balances performance, flexibility, and compliance requirements while supporting both anonymous and authenticated usage patterns, with special attention to document versioning needs for the track changes functionality.

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### API DESIGN

The AI writing enhancement interface requires robust integration with external services while providing a consistent API for client applications. This section outlines the integration architecture that enables secure and efficient communication between system components and external services.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Specifications |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| REST/HTTP | Primary API protocol | JSON payloads, HTTP status codes for error handling, standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| WebSockets | Real-time updates | Used for streaming suggestion updates and collaborative features |
| HTTPS | Transport security | TLS 1.2+, perfect forward secrecy, strong cipher suites |

#### Authentication Methods

| API Consumer | Authentication Method | Implementation |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Web Application | JWT tokens | Short-lived access tokens (1 hour) with refresh tokens (7 days) |
| Anonymous Users | Session tokens | Cryptographically secure session IDs stored in HTTP-only cookies |
| External Services | API keys + HMAC | Request signing with timestamp validation and nonce checking |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant AuthService
    
    User->>Client: Login Request
    Client->>AuthService: Authenticate
    AuthService->>API: Validate Credentials
    API->>AuthService: Create JWT Tokens
    AuthService->>Client: Return Access/Refresh Tokens
    Client->>API: Request with Access Token
    API->>API: Validate Token
    API->>Client: Return Response
    
    Note over Client,API: Token Refresh Flow
    Client->>AuthService: Send Refresh Token
    AuthService->>API: Generate New Access Token
    AuthService->>Client: Return New Access Token
```

#### Authorization Framework

| Resource Type | Authorization Model | Implementation |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| User Documents | Ownership-based | Document creator has full access; explicit sharing permissions for others |
| Shared Templates | Role-based | Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles with corresponding permissions |
| System Features | Capability-based | Feature flags tied to user subscription level |

The system implements a multi-layered authorization approach:
1. Authentication identity verification
2. Resource-level permission checks
3. Operation-level capability verification
4. Data-level filtering based on access rights

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| API Consumer | Rate Limit | Enforcement |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Anonymous Users | 10 requests/minute for AI suggestions | Token bucket algorithm with decay |
| Authenticated Users | 50 requests/minute for AI suggestions | Token bucket with subscription tiers |
| Admin Operations | 100 requests/minute | Fixed window counter |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Request] --> B{Rate Limit Check}
    B -->|Within Limit| C[Process Request]
    B -->|Limit Exceeded| D[429 Too Many Requests]
    C --> E[Return Response]
    D --> F[Include Retry-After Header]
    
    subgraph "Rate Limit Enforcement"
        G[Token Bucket] -->|Consume Token| B
        H[Request Timer] -->|Refill Tokens| G
    end
```

#### Versioning Approach

| Versioning Component | Strategy | Implementation |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| API Versioning | URL-based major versions | `/api/v1/documents`, `/api/v2/documents` |
| Backward Compatibility | Response enrichment | Add new fields without removing existing ones |
| API Lifecycle | Deprecation periods | Minimum 6-month deprecation notice before removing endpoints |

#### Documentation Standards

| Queue | Purpose | Technology |
|-------|---------|------------|
| AI Request Queue | Buffer AI processing requests | Redis Queue |
| Document Processing | Handle document analysis tasks | AWS SQS |
| Email Notifications | Manage user communications | AWS SQS + SNS |

For AI suggestion processing, the system implements a priority queue based on:
1. User subscription level
2. Request complexity
3. Document size
4. Current system load

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Request Validator]

        F[Collect Usage Data] --> G[Calculate Acceptance Rates]
        G --> H[Identify Improvement Areas]
        H --> I[Update Templates]
    end
```

#### Error Handling Strategy

| Error Type | Strategy | Recovery Mechanism |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| AI Service Timeout | Retry with backoff | Circuit breaker pattern after 3 failures |
| Authentication Failures | Clear credentials | Redirect to re-authentication flow |
| API Rate Limiting | Queue and retry | Exponential backoff with user notification |
| Data Validation Errors | Client-side validation | Clear error messages with correction guidance |

### EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

Escalation triggers include:
- Incident unresolved after 30 minutes
- Multiple components affected
- Customer impact exceeding thresholds
- Unknown root cause after initial investigation
- Security or data privacy concerns

#### Runbook Structure

All critical system components have associated runbooks containing:

1. Component overview and architecture diagram
2. Common failure modes and symptoms
3. Diagnostic procedures and required tools
4. Step-by-step recovery instructions
5. Verification steps to confirm resolution
6. Contact information for specialized support
7. Rollback procedures if resolution fails

Runbooks are stored in a centralized knowledge base with:
- Version control and review history
- Regular testing during simulation exercises
- Continuous improvement based on incident learnings
- Integration with monitoring dashboards

#### Post-Mortem Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incident Resolved] --> B[Schedule Post-mortem]
    B --> C[Prepare Timeline]
    C --> D[Analysis Meeting]
    
    D --> E[Document Root Causes]
    D --> F[Identify Contributing Factors]
    D --> G[Define Action Items]
    
    E --> H[Post-mortem Document]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    
    H --> I[Distribute Findings]
    I --> J[Track Action Items]
    
    J --> K[Weekly Review]
    K --> L{Actions Complete?}
    L -->|No| K
    L -->|Yes| M[Close Post-mortem]
    
    M --> N[Add to Knowledge Base]
    N --> O[Quarterly Analysis]
```

The post-mortem process follows a blameless approach focusing on:
- Factual timeline without attribution of fault
- Systemic causes rather than individual mistakes
- Contributing factors including technical and process issues
- Concrete, assignable, and trackable action items
- Prevention of similar incidents in the future

#### Reliability Improvement Tracking

| Metric | Calculation | Target | Review Frequency |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Mean Time Between Failures | Average time between service-impacting incidents | >30 days | Monthly |
| Mean Time To Resolve | Average time from alert to resolution | <60 minutes | Weekly |
| Mean Time To Detect | Average time from issue to alert | <5 minutes | Weekly |
| Recurring Incidents | Count of similar incidents | 0 | Monthly |

Improvement initiatives are tracked using:
- Dedicated reliability backlog items
- Engineering time allocation for reliability work
- Trend analysis of incident frequency and impact
- Quarterly reliability retrospectives

### MONITORING DASHBOARD DESIGN

|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Document Editor | 99.9% | 95% of operations < 300ms | < 0.5% errors |
| AI Suggestions | 99.5% | 95% of suggestions < 5s | < 1% errors |
| User Authentication | 99.95% | 95% of operations < 500ms | < 0.1% errors |
| Document Storage | 99.99% | 95% of operations < 1s | < 0.1% errors |

The system implements an error budget approach where:
- Each component has an allocated monthly error budget
- Budget consumption is tracked in real-time 
- Approaching budget limits triggers escalating alerts
- Exhausted budgets initiate emergency response procedures
- Remaining budget informs feature vs. stability prioritization

### SYNTHETIC MONITORING

| Critical Path | Test Frequency | Success Criteria | Alert Trigger |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Homepage Load | 1 minute | < 2s load time | 3 consecutive failures |
| Document Creation | 5 minutes | Successful creation < 3s | 2 consecutive failures |
| AI Suggestion | 10 minutes | Successful suggestion < 6s | 2 consecutive failures |
| User Login | 5 minutes | Successful auth < 2s | 2 consecutive failures |

Synthetic tests are executed from multiple geographic regions to:
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Measure performance from user perspective
- Detect regional availability issues
- Validate third-party integrations
- Provide early warning before user impact

The monitoring and observability architecture ensures complete visibility into the AI writing enhancement system's health and performance, enabling rapid detection and resolution of issues while providing insights for continuous improvement.

#### Resource Requirements

| Component | CPU | Memory | Storage | Network |
|-----------|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| Frontend | 0.5-1 vCPU | 2GB | 10GB | Medium |
| API Services | 1-2 vCPU | 4GB | 20GB | High |
| AI Orchestration | 2-4 vCPU | 8GB | 20GB | High |
| Database | 4-8 vCPU | 16GB | 100GB + scaling | High |
| Cache | 2-4 vCPU | 8GB | 20GB | High |

These specifications represent initial deployment targets with auto-scaling configured to adjust resources based on actual usage patterns. The AI orchestration services have higher resource allocations due to the computational requirements of processing and optimizing AI requests.

#### Environment Management

| Aspect | Implementation | Tools |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform for all AWS resources | Terraform Cloud, AWS CDK |
| Configuration Management | Environment-specific parameter stores | AWS Parameter Store, Secrets Manager |
| Environment Promotion | Promotion pipeline with validation gates | GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline |
| Backup Strategy | Automated backups with retention policies | MongoDB Atlas backups, S3 versioning |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Development] -->|Manual Promotion| B[Staging]
    B -->|Automated Tests| C{Quality Gate}
    C -->|Pass| D[Production]
    C -->|Fail| B
    D -->|Critical Issue| E[Rollback]
    E --> D
    
    subgraph "Environment Configuration"
        F[Base Configuration] --> G[Dev Overrides]
        F --> H[Staging Overrides]
        F --> I[Production Overrides]
    end
```

The environment management strategy follows a traditional promotion model with increasingly stringent validation at each stage. Infrastructure changes follow the same pipeline, with Terraform plans reviewed before application.

#### Disaster Recovery Plan

| Recovery Aspect | Strategy | SLA Target |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | < 1 hour | 99.9% compliance |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | < 5 minutes | 99.9% compliance |
| Data Backup | Continuous replication + daily snapshots | 7-day point-in-time recovery |
| Infrastructure Recovery | Infrastructure as Code with automated deployment | Complete rebuild < 2 hours |

The disaster recovery strategy includes multi-region redundancy for critical components, with automated failover capabilities for the database and caching layers. Regular DR drills are scheduled quarterly to validate recovery procedures.

### CLOUD SERVICES

#### Core Cloud Services

| Service | Purpose | Configuration |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| AWS ECS | Container orchestration | Fargate for serverless container management |
| AWS RDS | Database alternative (if not using MongoDB Atlas) | Multi-AZ deployment |
| Amazon ElastiCache | Session caching and distributed locking | Redis 7.0, cluster mode |
| AWS S3 | Document storage and static assets | Versioning enabled, lifecycle policies |
| AWS CloudFront | Content delivery network | Edge optimization for global users |
| AWS CloudWatch | Monitoring and alerting | Custom dashboards, composite alarms |

#### High Availability Design

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Region A - Primary"
        A1[ALB] --> B1[ECS Cluster]
        B1 --> C1[Service Instances]
        D1[Primary DB]
        E1[Cache Cluster]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region B - Failover"
        A2[ALB] --> B2[ECS Cluster]
        B2 --> C2[Service Instances]
        D2[Replica DB]
        E2[Cache Cluster]
    end
    
    D1 -->|Replication| D2
    E1 -->|Replication| E2
    
    F[Route 53] --> A1
    F -->|Failover| A2
    
    G[CloudFront] --> A1
    G -->|Failover| A2
    
    H[S3 - Multi-Region] --> G
```

The high availability design employs multi-AZ deployments within each region and cross-region replication for critical data services. Route 53 health checks trigger automated failover to the secondary region if the primary becomes unavailable.

#### Cost Optimization Strategy

| Area | Strategy | Estimated Savings |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Compute | Auto-scaling based on demand patterns | 20-30% |
| AI Processing | Request batching and caching of similar requests | 30-40% |
| Storage | Tiered storage with lifecycle policies | 15-25% |
| Reserved Instances | Commitments for baseline capacity | 30-40% |

Monthly infrastructure cost estimates:
- Development environment: $1,000 - $1,500
- Staging environment: $1,500 - $2,500
- Production environment: $3,000 - $8,000 (scaling with usage)

AI service costs (OpenAI API) are estimated separately at approximately $0.02-0.10 per document processed, depending on complexity and length.

#### Security and Compliance

| Security Aspect | Implementation | Monitoring |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| Network Security | VPC with private subnets, security groups | VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty |
| Data Encryption | Encryption at rest and in transit | CloudTrail, Config rules |
| Identity Management | IAM with least privilege, service roles | CloudTrail, IAM Access Analyzer |
| Compliance Monitoring | Automated compliance checks | AWS Config, Security Hub |

The infrastructure implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple security layers and regular automated security assessments. All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, with key management through AWS KMS.

### CONTAINERIZATION

#### Container Strategy

| Aspect | Specification | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Platform | Docker | Industry standard with robust tooling |
| Base Images | Slim variants of official images | Security and size optimization |
| Build Process | Multi-stage builds | Smaller final images, improved security |
| Registry | Amazon ECR | Tight integration with AWS services |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Source Code] --> B[Build Stage]
    B --> C[Test Stage]
    C --> D[Security Scan]
    D --> E[Production Image]
    E --> F[ECR Repository]
    F --> G[ECS Deployment]
    
    subgraph "Multi-stage Build"
        H[Build Environment] --> I[Dependencies]
        I --> J[Compile/Bundle]
        J --> K[Final Minimal Image]
    end
```

#### Image Versioning Approach

| Component | Versioning Strategy | Tagging Scheme |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Frontend | Semantic versioning | `${service}-${semver}-${commit}` |
| Backend Services | Semantic versioning | `${service}-${semver}-${commit}` |
| Base Images | Fixed version tags | Specific version (not `latest`) |

Each container image is tagged with both semantic version and commit hash for traceability. The `latest` tag is never used in production to ensure deployment consistency and facilitate rollbacks.

#### Container Security

| Security Measure | Tool/Approach | Implementation |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Image Scanning | Trivy, ECR scanning | Pre-push and scheduled scans |
| Runtime Protection | AppArmor profiles | Container isolation |
| Secrets Management | AWS Secrets Manager | No secrets in images |
| Minimal Permissions | Non-root users | Least privilege principle |

All images undergo security scanning before deployment, with policies preventing the deployment of images with high or critical vulnerabilities. Containers run as non-root users with read-only file systems where possible.

### ORCHESTRATION

#### Orchestration Platform

| Aspect | Selection | Justification |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Platform | AWS ECS with Fargate | Simplified management, tight AWS integration |
| Task Definition Strategy | One container per task | Improved resource allocation and scaling |
| Service Mesh | AWS App Mesh | Service discovery and traffic management |
| Load Balancing | Application Load Balancer | Path-based routing, WebSocket support |

Amazon ECS with Fargate was selected over Kubernetes due to lower operational overhead and sufficient capabilities for the application's needs. This approach allows the team to focus on application development rather than cluster management.

#### Cluster Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "ECS Cluster"
        A[Application Load Balancer]
        
        subgraph "Frontend Service"
            B[Task 1]
            C[Task 2]
            D[Task N]
        end
        
        subgraph "API Service"
            E[Task 1]
            F[Task 2]
            G[Task N]
        end
        
        subgraph "AI Service"
            H[Task 1]
            I[Task 2]
            J[Task N]
        end
        
        A --> B
        A --> C
        A --> D
        A --> E
        A --> F
        A --> G
        A --> H
        A --> I
        A --> J
    end
    
    K[Service Discovery] --> A
```

#### Auto-scaling Configuration

| Service | Scaling Metric | Scale Out | Scale In | Min/Max |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Frontend | CPU Utilization | >70% for 3 min | <30% for 10 min | 2/10 |
| API Service | Request Count/Target | >1000 req/target | <200 req/target | 2/20 |
| AI Service | Queue Depth | >20 items | <5 items for 10 min | 2/30 |

Auto-scaling policies are configured to handle traffic spikes while preventing rapid scaling fluctuations. The AI service has more aggressive scaling policies due to the compute-intensive nature of AI processing.

#### Resource Allocation Policies

| Service | CPU Allocation | Memory Allocation | Reserved vs. On-Demand |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Frontend | 0.5 vCPU | 1 GB | 50% Reserved |
| API Service | 1 vCPU | 2 GB | 70% Reserved |
| AI Service | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 30% Reserved |

Resource allocation is optimized based on the specific needs of each service. The AI service uses more on-demand capacity due to its variable workload pattern, while more predictable services use reserved capacity for cost optimization.
