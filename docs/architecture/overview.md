The system is organized into several key layers:
- **Client Layer**: Browser-based React application with rich document editing
- **API Layer**: RESTful services for backend functionality
- **Service Layer**: Core business logic and processing
- **Data Layer**: Storage for documents, user data, and system state
- **External Integrations**: AI services and supporting infrastructure

## Architecture Principles

The architecture adheres to several core principles that guide its design and implementation:

### Application Architecture Style

The application follows a Single Page Application (SPA) approach using React, providing a responsive, desktop-like experience for document editing. This architecture was chosen because it:
- Minimizes latency for document editing operations
- Enables rich user interactions without page reloads
- Supports client-side processing for immediate feedback
- Allows offline-capable functionality where appropriate

### Backend Organization

The backend follows a modular monolith approach with clear service boundaries. This design:
- Balances development velocity with service isolation
- Establishes clear interfaces between functional areas
- Avoids distributed system complexity in the initial release
- Provides a migration path to microservices if future scaling requires it

### State Management Approach

The platform implements a client-heavy state management approach with server synchronization:
- Document editing state primarily managed in the browser
- Critical data synchronized with the server at appropriate intervals
- Redis caching for session data and frequent access patterns
- Support for offline editing with synchronization on reconnection

### AI Integration Pattern

The integration with AI services follows an asynchronous request-response pattern with streaming options:
- Asynchronous processing accommodates variable LLM response times
- Streaming responses enable progressive rendering of suggestions
- Prompt templates and optimization improve AI response quality
- Caching of similar requests reduces API costs and improves responsiveness

## System Components

The system consists of several key components that work together to provide the complete functionality. This section provides an overview of each component area, with links to detailed documentation.

### Frontend Components

The frontend is a React-based Single Page Application that provides the primary user interface:

- **Document Editor**: Built on ProseMirror, providing rich text editing with track changes capabilities
- **Track Changes System**: Microsoft Word-like interface for reviewing AI suggestions
- **Sidebar Interface**: Context-aware panel providing access to AI capabilities
- **Authentication Components**: Login, registration, and session management

The frontend emphasizes responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization to handle large documents efficiently.

For detailed frontend architecture documentation, see [Frontend Architecture](./frontend.md).

### Backend Services

The backend is built on Flask with a modular organization:

- **Document Service**: Manages document storage, retrieval, and version management
- **AI Orchestration Service**: Processes document content with AI models to generate suggestions
- **User Service**: Handles authentication, profiles, and session management
- **Template Service**: Manages predefined improvement templates

The backend services are designed to be stateless for horizontal scalability, with appropriate caching and performance optimizations.

For detailed backend architecture documentation, see [Backend Architecture](./backend.md).

### Data Storage

The data storage layer employs a polyglot persistence approach:

- **MongoDB**: Document-oriented database for structured metadata and user data
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching, sessions, and rate limiting
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for document content and version history

This multi-database approach balances flexibility, performance, and cost-efficiency for different data access patterns.

For detailed database architecture documentation, see [Database Architecture](./database.md).

### AI Integration

The AI integration components manage interactions with language models:

- **OpenAI Connector**: Manages communication with the OpenAI API
- **Prompt Management**: Sophisticated prompt engineering for optimal results
- **Response Processing**: Converts AI outputs into actionable suggestions
- **Token Optimization**: Strategies for efficient token usage and cost management

The AI integration is designed to balance quality, performance, and cost considerations.

For detailed AI integration documentation, see [AI Integration Architecture](./ai-integration.md).

### Security Components

Security is implemented throughout the system with several key components:

- **Authentication Framework**: Supporting both anonymous and authenticated access
- **Authorization System**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, masking, and secure storage of sensitive data
- **Security Monitoring**: Detection and response to potential security events

The security architecture balances strong protection with usability considerations.

For detailed security architecture documentation, see [Security Architecture](./security.md).

## Data Flow

This section describes how data flows through the system during key user scenarios.

![Data Flow Diagram](../assets/data-flow-diagram.png)

### Document Creation and Editing

1. User inputs document content through the browser (paste, type, or upload)
2. Frontend processes and normalizes content in the document editor
3. ProseMirror maintains document state with real-time updates
4. Document changes are periodically synchronized to backend storage
5. For authenticated users, documents are persisted to MongoDB with S3 storage
6. For anonymous users, documents are stored in browser session with reminders about limitations

### AI Suggestion Generation

1. User selects text and chooses an improvement template (or provides custom prompt)
2. Frontend sends document content and prompt to the backend API
3. AI Orchestration Service processes the request, optimizing context and tokens
4. OpenAI API generates suggestions based on the optimized prompt
5. Backend transforms suggestions into track changes format
6. Frontend renders suggestions inline using the track changes interface
7. User reviews and accepts/rejects each suggestion
8. Accepted changes are applied to the document model

### Anonymous to Authenticated Transition

1. Anonymous user creates and edits documents with session-based storage
2. User decides to register or log in to save work permanently
3. After authentication, system migrates documents from session to user account
4. Session documents are copied to user's storage with appropriate metadata
5. User continues with authenticated access to preserved documents

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed using a container-based approach on AWS infrastructure.
