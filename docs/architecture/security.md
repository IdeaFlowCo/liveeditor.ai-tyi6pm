## Authentication Framework

The authentication system supports both anonymous and authenticated access paths while maintaining security for user data and documents.

### Identity Management

The platform implements the following identity management components:

- **Anonymous Access**: Session-based identifiers enable immediate usage without login
- **User Registration**: Email verification flow establishes verified user identities
- **Account Recovery**: Time-limited reset tokens provide secure account recovery
- **Identity Storage**: Credentials stored with bcrypt hashing and appropriate salting

| Method | Implementation | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Email/Password | Bcrypt hashing (cost factor 12) | Primary authentication method |
| OAuth Integration | Support for Google, Microsoft identities | Simplified authentication option |
| Anonymous Sessions | Secure session identifiers | Immediate access without registration |

### Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication is implemented with the following components:

- **Email Verification**: One-time codes sent for account registration
- **Recovery Codes**: Pre-generated backup codes for account recovery
- **Optional TOTP**: Time-based one-time passwords for enhanced security

### Session Management

Session management is implemented with security as a priority:

| Session Type | Duration | Storage | Renewal Mechanism |
|--------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Anonymous | 24 hours | Browser storage + server session | Automatic with activity |
| Authenticated | 2 hours (access token) | HTTP-only cookies | Refresh token (7 days) |
| Remember Me | 30 days | Secure HTTP-only cookie | Rotating refresh tokens |

### Token Handling

The system implements a secure token handling approach:

- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWTs for API authorization
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived tokens for obtaining new access tokens
- **Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated with each use
- **Token Revocation**: Centralized mechanism for revoking compromised tokens

All tokens are transmitted over HTTPS and stored securely with appropriate HTTP security headers.

    API->>Auth: Validate refresh token
    Auth->>Auth: Generate new token pair
    Auth-->>API: New access + refresh tokens
    API-->>Client: Store new tokens
```

### Password Policies

The system enforces strong password policies:

- **Minimum Length**: 10 characters
- **Complexity**: Combination of character types required
- **History**: No reuse of last 5 passwords
- **Max Age**: Optional 90-day rotation
- **Breach Detection**: Check against known breached passwords

Password policies are enforced at both client and server levels with appropriate user feedback.

## Authorization System

The authorization system implements role-based access control with fine-grained permissions for different user types.

### Role-based Access Control

The platform uses a role-based access control model with the following roles:

- **Anonymous**: Unauthenticated users with limited functionality
- **User**: Authenticated users with access to their own content
- **Admin**: System administrators with elevated privileges

Roles determine available features, resource access, and administrative capabilities.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Authentication}
    B -->|Anonymous| C[Anonymous Role]
    B -->|Authenticated| D[User Role]
    B -->|Admin| E[Admin Role]
    
    C --> F{Document Access}
    D --> F
    E --> F
    E --> G[System Administration]
    
    F -->|Own Document| H[Full Access]
    F -->|Shared Document| I{Permission Check}
    F -->|Public Document| J[Read Access]
    
    I -->|Owner| K[Full Control]
    I -->|Editor| L[Edit Access]
    I -->|Viewer| M[View Only]
```

### Permission Management

The system implements granular permissions for different operations:
