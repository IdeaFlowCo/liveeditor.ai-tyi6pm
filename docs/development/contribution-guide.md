```

## Contribution Workflow

### Finding an Issue to Work On
1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/example/ai-writing-enhancement/issues) page for open tasks
2. Filter by labels such as `good-first-issue`, `bug`, `enhancement`
3. Comment on the issue you'd like to work on to express your interest
4. Wait for a maintainer to assign you the issue

### Creating a New Issue
If you found a bug or have a feature idea:
1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use the appropriate issue template (bug report or feature request)
3. Provide all requested information in detail
4. Add relevant labels if you have permission

### Branching Strategy
We follow a standard GitHub flow with feature branches:

1. Ensure your main branch is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-spell-check
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/editor-crash
   ```

   Branch naming conventions:
   - `feature/<feature-name>` - For new features
   - `fix/<bug-name>` - For bug fixes
   - `docs/<doc-name>` - For documentation changes
   - `refactor/<component-name>` - For code refactoring
   - `test/<test-name>` - For adding or improving tests

### Commit Guidelines
We follow conventional commits for clear history and automated changelog generation:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `test`: Adding or improving tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies, etc.

Examples:
```
feat(editor): add spell-check functionality
fix(ai-service): resolve token limit issue with large documents
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(track-changes): add tests for accepting multiple changes
```

### Development Process
1. Make your changes following the coding standards
2. Add or update tests for your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass locally
4. Add or update documentation as needed
5. Commit your changes using conventional commit format
6. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-spell-check
   ```

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility
- Write code for readability first, optimization second
- Comment complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Respect existing patterns and conventions in the codebase

### Frontend Standards (TypeScript/React)

#### Code Formatting
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting PRs
- Configure your editor to use the project's `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc`

#### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `DocumentEditor.tsx`)
- Files: Same as the main export (usually PascalCase for components)
- Functions: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for truly constant values
- Interfaces/Types: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `DocumentMetadata`)

#### Component Organization
- One component per file (except for small, related components)
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use the following structure for component files:
  ```typescript
  // Imports
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  
  // Types
  interface Props {
    // ...
  }
  
  // Helper functions
  function helperFunction() {
    // ...
  }
  
  // Component
  export function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }: Props) {
    // Hooks
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
    
    // Effects
    useEffect(() => {
      // ...
    }, [dependencies]);
    
    // Event handlers
    const handleEvent = () => {
      // ...
    };
    
    // Render
    return (
      <div>
        {/* JSX */}
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

#### React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Minimize state and use appropriate state management (local vs. Redux)
- Memoize expensive calculations or component renders
- Use TypeScript properly - avoid `any` type where possible
- Break large components into smaller, focused components
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching

#### CSS/Styling
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes as the primary styling method
- Create custom components for repeated UI patterns
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

### Backend Standards (Python/Flask)

#### Code Formatting
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Run `black .` and `isort .` before submitting PRs
- Configure your editor to use the project's `.pylintrc`

#### Naming Conventions
- Files: snake_case
- Classes: PascalCase
- Functions/Methods: snake_case
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Variables: snake_case

#### Organization
- Organize code by feature domain rather than technical concern
- Follow a modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns (repository pattern, service layer, etc.)

#### Python Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints to improve code clarity and IDE support
- Write descriptive docstrings in Google format
- Handle exceptions gracefully and specifically
- Use context managers for resource management
- Prefer composition over inheritance

#### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles for API endpoints
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- Implement proper input validation
- Provide clear error messages with actionable information
- Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger

### Database Standards
- Write clear and efficient queries
- Use appropriate indexes for performance
- Follow the repository pattern for data access
- Implement proper data validation at the database level
- Use migrations for schema changes

### AI Integration Standards
- Implement proper error handling for AI service calls
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API costs
- Sanitize inputs to prevent prompt injection
- Implement fallback mechanisms for service unavailability
- Optimize token usage to manage costs

## Testing Requirements

We maintain high testing standards to ensure reliability and maintainability. For complete testing documentation, refer to the [Testing Strategy and Implementation](docs/development/testing.md) document.

pytest --cov=.          # Generate coverage report
```

### Test-Driven Development
We encourage a TDD approach:
1. Write a failing test for the feature or fix
2. Implement the code to make the test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing

### Continuous Integration
All tests run automatically on pull requests. PRs cannot be merged until:
- All tests pass
- Coverage requirements are met
- Code quality checks pass

## Pull Request Process

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation
- Document all public functions, classes, and methods
- Use clear, concise comments for complex logic
- For TypeScript, use JSDoc format:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Formats the suggested changes into track changes format
   * @param originalText - The original document text
   * @param suggestions - Array of suggested changes
   * @returns Formatted text with track changes markup
   */
  function formatTrackChanges(originalText: string, suggestions: Suggestion[]): string {
    // Implementation
  }
  ```
- For Python, use Google-style docstrings:
  ```python
  def generate_suggestions(document_text, prompt_template=None):
      """Generates AI-powered writing suggestions.
      
      Args:
          document_text (str): The document text to analyze
          prompt_template (Optional[str]): Template ID to use for suggestions
          
      Returns:
          List[Suggestion]: A list of suggested changes
          
      Raises:
          ValidationError: If document text exceeds size limits
          AIServiceError: If the AI service is unavailable
      """
      # Implementation
  ```
