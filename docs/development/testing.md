# Testing Strategy and Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the AI writing enhancement platform, including methodologies, tools, and best practices for both frontend and backend components. The testing approach is designed to ensure high-quality, maintainable code that meets the specified requirements while providing a solid foundation for continuous development.

## Testing Approach

Our testing strategy includes multiple layers of testing to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### Unit Testing

Testing individual components in isolation to verify their correct behavior.

- Frontend: Jest with React Testing Library for React components and utilities
- Backend: pytest for Python module and class testing
- Mocking strategy for external dependencies to ensure isolation
- Code coverage requirements: 80% statements, 85% functions, 75% branches overall
- Higher coverage requirements for critical components (AI, Editor)

### Integration Testing

Testing interactions between components and services to ensure they work together correctly.

- Backend API integration tests with pytest
- Frontend component integration with MSW for API mocking
- Service-to-service integration validation
- Database integration testing with in-memory databases

### End-to-End Testing

Testing complete user workflows through the entire application stack.

- Critical path testing for core user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Authentication and user role validation
- Document editing and AI suggestion flows

### Performance Testing

Testing application performance characteristics under various conditions.

- Page load and time-to-interactive measurements
- API response time validation
- AI suggestion generation performance
- Track changes rendering with large documents

### Security Testing

Testing the application for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security requirements.

- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Authentication and authorization validation
- AI-specific security testing (prompt injection, data leakage)

## Frontend Testing

The frontend application uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

### Setup and Configuration

Frontend testing is configured with Jest and TypeScript support.

- Configuration file: `src/web/jest.config.ts`
- Test setup: `src/web/__tests__/setup.ts`
- Mock service worker for API mocking
- Testing utilities in `src/web/src/__tests__/utils/`

### Component Testing

React components are tested with React Testing Library.

- Use `renderWithProviders` from test-utils.tsx to wrap components with necessary providers
- Test file naming convention: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Test folders structure mirrors component structure
- Snapshot testing for UI components
- Event simulation with userEvent and fireEvent

```tsx
// Example component test
import { renderWithProviders, screen } from '../../utils/test-utils';
import Editor from '../../../components/editor/Editor';

test('renders editor with initial content', async () => {
  renderWithProviders(<Editor initialContent="Test content" />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Test content')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### API Mocking

API requests are mocked using Mock Service Worker (MSW).

- Mock handlers defined in `src/web/src/__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts`
- Server setup in `src/web/src/__tests__/mocks/server.ts`
- Custom response simulation for testing different scenarios
- Request interception for validation

```tsx
// Example API mock handler
import { rest } from 'msw';
import { API_ROUTES } from '../../constants/api';

export const handlers = [
  rest.post(API_ROUTES.SUGGESTIONS, (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.status(200),
      ctx.json({
        suggestions: [
          {
            original: 'needs to',
            suggestion: 'should',
            explanation: 'More professional phrasing'
          }
        ]
      })
    );
  })
];
```

### State Management Testing

Redux state management is tested with Redux toolkit utilities.

- Slice tests for reducers and selectors
- Middleware testing for side effects
- Integration with components through connected components

### Coverage Requirements

Frontend code coverage requirements are enforced per component type.

- Overall: 80% statements, 85% functions, 75% branches, 80% lines
- Editor components: 85% statements, 90% functions, 80% branches, 85% lines
- AI components: 90% statements, 90% functions, 85% branches, 90% lines

## Backend Testing

The backend application uses pytest for unit and integration testing.

### Setup and Configuration

Backend testing is configured with pytest and related tools.

- Configuration file: `src/backend/tests/conftest.py`
- Test fixtures for database, authentication, and services
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Test database isolation with MongoDB mocking

### Unit Testing

Backend modules and classes are tested with pytest.

- Test file naming convention: `test_module_name.py`
- Test structure mirrors application structure
- Mocking strategy using unittest.mock and pytest fixtures
- Parameterized tests for different scenarios

```python
# Example backend unit test
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from src.backend.core.ai.openai_service import OpenAIService

def test_get_suggestions(mock_openai):
    # Setup test data
    service = OpenAIService(api_key="test-key")
    document = "Sample document text"
    prompt = "Make it more professional"
    
    # Call function under test
    result = service.get_suggestions(document, prompt)
    
    # Assertions
    assert result is not None
    assert "suggestions" in result
    assert mock_openai.was_called_with(correct_parameters)
```

### API Integration Testing

Backend API endpoints are tested with Flask test client.

- End-to-end API testing with test databases
- Authentication and authorization validation
- Request and response validation
- Error handling and edge cases

```python
# Example API integration test
import pytest
import json

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_create_document_authenticated(client, db, setup_test_user, auth_header):
    # Test data
    document_data = {
        "title": "Test Document",
        "content": "This is a test document."
    }
    
    # Make request
    response = client.post(
        '/api/documents',
        data=json.dumps(document_data),
        headers=auth_header,
        content_type='application/json'
    )
    
    # Assertions
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = json.loads(response.data)
    assert "document_id" in data
    assert data["title"] == document_data["title"]
```

### AI Service Testing
