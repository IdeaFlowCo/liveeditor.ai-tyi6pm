```

### 2.3 Retention Policies

The system applies the following data retention policies:

| Data Category | Retention Period | Deletion Process |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| User Accounts | Until deletion + 30 days | Soft delete, then anonymize |
| User Documents | Until deletion + 30 days | Soft delete, then purge |
| Anonymous Documents | 7 days from last access | Automatic purge |
| AI Interaction Logs | 90 days | Anonymize after 30 days |
| Authentication Logs | 1 year | Automated archival |
| Full Backups | 30 days | Secure deletion with verification |
| Incremental Backups | 7 days | Secure deletion with verification |
| Oplog Backups | 72 hours | Automatic rotation |

### 2.4 Backup Security

All backups implement the following security measures:

- **Encryption at rest** using AES-256 encryption
- **Encryption in transit** using TLS 1.3
- **Access controls** limited to authorized operations personnel
- **Immutability protection** for 24 hours to prevent immediate tampering
- **Audit logs** for all backup access and restoration activities

## 3. Backup Procedures

### 3.1 Database Backup Procedure

#### 3.1.1 Automated Full Backups

Full database backups are performed automatically by the backup management system on the following schedule:

```
Schedule: Daily at 01:00 UTC
Target: MongoDB Production Cluster
Retention: 30 days
Verification: Automated integrity check after completion
```

The backup process uses MongoDB's native backup capabilities with the following parameters:

```
mongodump --host mongodb://${PRIMARY_HOST}:${PORT} \
  --username ${BACKUP_USER} \
  --password ${BACKUP_PASSWORD} \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --oplog \
  --out /backup/full/$(date +%Y%m%d) \
  --gzip
```

#### 3.1.2 Incremental Backups

Incremental backups capture changes since the last full or incremental backup:

```
Schedule: Every 6 hours (03:00, 09:00, 15:00, 21:00 UTC)
Target: MongoDB Production Cluster
Retention: 7 days
Method: Oplog capture since previous backup
```

#### 3.1.3 Manual Backup Procedure

In case manual backups are required:

1. Log in to the backup management console at https://backup-admin.internal
2. Navigate to "Manual Backup" section
3. Select the target database cluster
4. Choose backup type (Full or Incremental)
5. Add a descriptive label with reason for manual backup
6. Click "Start Backup" and monitor progress

### 3.2 Document Storage Backup

Document content is stored in MongoDB with the following backup procedures:

1. All documents are included in the regular MongoDB backup schedule
2. Documents marked as critical receive additional point-in-time versioning
3. S3 document backups (for external storage) are handled by automated daily sync:

```
Schedule: Daily at 02:00 UTC
Source: MongoDB document collections
Target: S3 encrypted bucket (s3://aiwriting-backup-documents/)
Retention: Matches MongoDB retention (30 days)
```

### 3.3 Configuration and Infrastructure Backup

System configuration and infrastructure definitions are version-controlled:

1. All Terraform configurations are stored in the GitHub repository
2. Infrastructure state files are backed up daily:

```
Schedule: Daily at 00:30 UTC
Source: Terraform state files
Target: S3 encrypted bucket (s3://aiwriting-backup-infra/)
Retention: 90 days with versioning enabled
```

3. Application configuration is captured via:

```
Schedule: After each deployment and daily at 00:15 UTC
Source: Configuration files and environment variables
Target: Encrypted Git repository + S3 bucket
Retention: 90 days with complete version history
```

### 3.4 Backup Validation Procedure

Each backup undergoes automated validation:

1. **Integrity Check**: Verification of backup file integrity and completeness
2. **Metadata Validation**: Confirmation that all database collections are included
3. **Restoration Test**: Weekly automated restoration to test environment
4. **Data Sampling**: Verification of randomly selected records

A validation report is generated after each backup with results sent to operations@example.com.

## 4. Disaster Recovery
