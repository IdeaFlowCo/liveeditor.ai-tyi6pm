# Deployment Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides comprehensive guidance for deploying the AI writing enhancement platform, covering various environments, CI/CD pipelines, containerization strategies, deployment procedures, verification steps, and rollback strategies. It is intended for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers involved in the deployment process.

## Deployment Environments
The AI writing enhancement platform supports the following deployment environments:

- **Development**: Used for local development and testing by developers.
- **Staging**: Used for integration testing and pre-production validation.
- **Production**: The live environment serving end-users.

Each environment has specific configurations and security requirements.

### Environment Configuration
Each environment is configured using Terraform, allowing for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and consistent deployments. Environment-specific settings are managed through AWS Parameter Store and Secrets Manager.

```terraform
# Example Terraform configuration for development environment
resource "aws_instance" "dev_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  key_name      = "dev-key"

  tags = {
    Name        = "dev-instance"
    Environment = "development"
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid and reliable releases. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions.

### Build Pipeline
The build pipeline is triggered on every code commit and performs the following steps:

1. **Linting and Code Quality Checks**: Enforces code style and identifies potential issues using ESLint and Pylint.
2. **Unit Tests**: Executes unit tests to verify individual component functionality.
3. **Integration Tests**: Runs integration tests to validate interactions between components.
4. **Security Scanning**: Scans code and dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy.
5. **Build Artifacts**: Creates container images for each service.
6. **Push to ECR**: Stores container images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

### Deployment Pipeline
The deployment pipeline is triggered after successful completion of the build pipeline and performs the following steps:

1. **Deploy to Development**: Deploys the application to the development environment.
2. **Automated Tests in Dev**: Runs automated tests to verify the deployment.
3. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploys the application to the staging environment.
4. **Full Test Suite**: Executes a comprehensive test suite, including integration and end-to-end tests.
5. **Manual Approval**: Requires manual approval before deploying to production.
6. **Deploy to Production**: Deploys the application to the production environment using a canary deployment strategy.
7. **Canary Deployment**: Gradually rolls out the new version to a subset of users.
8. **Health Checks**: Monitors system health and performance during the rollout.
9. **Full Production Deployment**: Completes the deployment to all users after successful canary testing.

## Containerization
The AI writing enhancement platform uses Docker containers for all services, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments across environments.

### Container Strategy
- **Base Images**: Uses slim variants of official images to minimize image size and improve security.
- **Build Process**: Employs multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.
- **Registry**: Stores container images in Amazon ECR.

### Image Versioning
Each container image is tagged with both semantic version and commit hash for traceability.

### Security Measures
- **Image Scanning**: Scans images for vulnerabilities using Trivy and ECR scanning.
- **Runtime Protection**: Uses AppArmor profiles for container isolation.
- **Secrets Management**: Stores secrets in AWS Secrets Manager and injects them into containers at runtime.
- **Minimal Permissions**: Runs containers as non-root users with read-only file systems where possible.

## Deployment Procedures

### Deploy to Development
```python
def deploy_to_development(version_tag: str, commit_hash: str) -> bool:
    """Procedure for deploying to the development environment"""
    # 1. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow for development
    # 2. Build container images
    # 3. Push to ECR with development tags
    # 4. Apply Terraform configuration for development
    # 5. Update ECS services
    # 6. Run post-deployment verification
    # 7. Update deployment status
    return True
```

### Deploy to Staging
```python
def deploy_to_staging(version_tag: str, commit_hash: str) -> bool:
    """Procedure for deploying to the staging environment"""
    # 1. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow for staging
    # 2. Build container images
    # 3. Push to ECR with staging tags
    # 4. Apply Terraform configuration for staging
    # 5. Update ECS services
    # 6. Run automated test suite
    # 7. Run post-deployment verification
    # 8. Update deployment status
    return True
```

### Deploy to Production
```python
def deploy_to_production(version_tag: str, commit_hash: str) -> bool:
    """Procedure for deploying to the production environment"""
    # 1. Perform pre-deployment checklist
    # 2. Create deployment plan
    # 3. Get approval from stakeholders
    # 4. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow for production
    # 5. Build container images
    # 6. Push to ECR with production tags
    # 7. Apply Terraform configuration for production
    # 8. Update ECS services with canary deployment
    # 9. Run post-deployment verification
    # 10. Monitor for issues during deployment window
    # 11. Complete deployment or initiate rollback if needed
    # 12. Update deployment status
    return True
```

### Rollback Procedure
```python
def rollback_deployment(environment: str, failed_version: str, target_version: str) -> bool:
    """Procedure for rolling back a failed deployment"""
    # 1. Identify the failure point
    # 2. Notify stakeholders of rollback
    # 3. Revert to previous working container images
    # 4. Apply previous Terraform state if needed
    # 5. Update ECS services to previous version
    # 6. Verify system functionality after rollback
    # 7. Document rollback reason and affected components
    # 8. Update deployment status
    return True
```

## Verification
After each deployment, perform the following verification steps:

1. **Check Service Status**: Verify that all services are running and healthy.
2. **Monitor Key Metrics**: Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and request latency.
3. **Run Automated Tests**: Execute automated tests to validate functionality.
4. **Perform Manual Testing**: Conduct manual testing to verify user experience.

## Rollback Strategies
In case of a failed deployment, implement the following rollback strategies:

1. **Revert to Previous Version**: Revert to the previous working container images and Terraform state.
2. **Rollback Deployment**: Use the deployment pipeline to redeploy the previous version.
3. **Disable New Features**: Temporarily disable new features to mitigate issues.
