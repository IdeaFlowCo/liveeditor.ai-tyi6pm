# Incident Response Procedures

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive incident response procedures for the AI writing enhancement platform. It provides structured approaches for detecting, classifying, responding to, and recovering from incidents that may affect our service availability, performance, data integrity, or security.

The primary objectives of our incident response procedures are to:
- Minimize service disruption and user impact
- Ensure consistent, effective response to incidents across the organization
- Facilitate rapid recovery from incidents
- Maintain clear communication with internal teams and external stakeholders
- Learn from incidents to prevent future recurrences

These procedures apply to all incidents affecting the AI writing enhancement platform, regardless of severity or origin, and are aligned with our broader security and operations policies.

## Incident Response Team

### Team Structure

The incident response team is structured to provide comprehensive coverage with clear lines of responsibility during incidents:

| Role | Primary Responsibility |
|------|--------------------------|
| Primary On-call | First responder for all incidents |
| Secondary On-call | Backup responder if primary is unavailable |
| Engineering Manager | Escalation point for technical issues |
| Operations Manager | Coordinates cross-functional response |
| Security Lead | Handles security-related incidents |
| Communications Lead | Manages internal and external communications |

The on-call rotation is managed through PagerDuty, with handoffs occurring weekly on Mondays at 9:00 AM local time. All team members can be reached through the #incident-response Slack channel or through the emergency phone bridge at the numbers listed in the Contact Information appendix.

### Incident Commander Role

For each incident, an Incident Commander (IC) is designated to coordinate the response. The Incident Commander is typically the Primary On-call responder, but this role may be transferred to a more appropriate team member depending on the nature of the incident.

The Incident Commander has the authority and responsibility to:
- Establish and maintain command of the incident response
- Coordinate the activities of the response team
- Make critical decisions during the incident
- Ensure timely and appropriate communications
- Declare incident resolution and initiate post-incident activities

When establishing command, the Incident Commander should:
1. Acknowledge the incident alert and announce assumption of command
2. Set up the appropriate communication channels
3. Begin documenting the incident timeline
4. Assign initial response team roles
5. Establish regular status update cadence
6. Set priorities for investigation and mitigation

### Supporting Roles

During incidents, the following supporting roles may be assigned:

**Technical Lead**
- Directs technical investigation and mitigation efforts
- Provides technical expertise relevant to the affected systems
- Recommends technical solutions to the Incident Commander
- Supervises implementation of technical remediation actions

**Communications Coordinator**
- Prepares and disseminates internal communications
- Drafts external communications for approval
- Updates status page and user notification systems
- Maintains communication log throughout the incident

**Operations Coordinator**
- Monitors system-wide impacts and dependencies
- Coordinates with external service providers when necessary
- Manages resource allocation during extended incidents
- Tracks action items and their completion status

**Scribe**
- Documents all actions, decisions, and findings during the incident
- Maintains the incident timeline
- Records assignments and their status
- Collects data for post-incident analysis

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into four severity levels, determining response times and escalation paths:

**P1: Critical**
- Description: Service outage, security breach
- Response Time: 15 minutes
- Examples: Complete platform unavailability, data breach, authentication system failure
- Notification Channels: Phone + SMS + Email + Slack

**P2: High**
- Description: Degraded performance, elevated errors
- Response Time: 30 minutes
- Examples: AI service unresponsive, high error rates, significant feature unavailability
- Notification Channels: SMS + Email + Slack

**P3: Medium**
- Description: Minor functionality issues
- Response Time: 4 hours
- Examples: Non-critical feature unavailable, intermittent errors affecting small subset of users
- Notification Channels: Email + Slack

**P4: Low**
- Description: Non-impacting anomalies
- Response Time: 24 hours
- Examples: Cosmetic issues, minor performance anomalies, isolated errors
- Notification Channels: Email

### Incident Types

Incidents affecting the AI writing enhancement platform generally fall into these categories:

**Service Availability Incidents**
- Complete service outage
- Partial service degradation
- Slow response times
- Feature-specific unavailability

**Performance Incidents**
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)

- Malicious code or injection attacks
- AI prompt injection attempts

**External Dependency Incidents**
- OpenAI API service disruption
- AWS service outages
- Third-party authentication issues
- CDN or network provider issues

### Impact Assessment

Impact is assessed across three dimensions to determine severity:

**User Impact**
- Number and percentage of affected users
- User-facing symptoms (complete outage, degraded experience)
- Criticality of affected features to users
- Duration of impact

**Business Impact**
- Revenue implications
- Reputational damage
- Regulatory compliance concerns
- Contract or SLA violations

**Technical Impact**
- Scope of affected systems
- Data integrity or loss risks
- Recovery complexity
- Security implications

## Incident Response Workflow

### Detection and Triage

**Incident Detection**
1. Receive alert notification from monitoring system
2. Verify alert authenticity and current status
3. Check for related alerts or known issues
4. Perform initial diagnostic verification steps
5. Classify as incident or false alarm
6. For incidents, proceed to classification and triage
7. For false alarms, update monitoring system to prevent recurrence

**Initial Triage**
1. Assess customer impact (number of users affected)
2. Evaluate business impact (revenue, reputation)
3. Determine technical impact (data loss, security)
4. Classify incident type (service outage, performance degradation, security breach)
5. Assign severity level (P1-P4) based on impact assessment
6. Identify affected components and potential scope
7. Document initial classification in incident management system

### Response Activation

The alert routing framework determines how incidents are routed to the appropriate personnel:

**Working Hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Local Time)**
- P1: Primary On-call → Secondary On-call (after 5min) → Escalation Manager
- P2: Primary On-call → Secondary On-call (after 10min) → Team Lead

- P4: Team Queue

**After Hours**
- P1: On-call Engineer → Secondary On-call (after 5min) → Escalation Manager
- P2: On-call Engineer → Secondary On-call (after 10min)
- P3: Tracked for next business day
- P4: Tracked for next business day

**Escalation Triggers**

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Objectives

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**

- The RTO applies to core platform functionality; additional features may be restored after the initial recovery

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**
- The platform has an RPO of 5 minutes
- This means a maximum of 5 minutes of data loss is acceptable during recovery
- RPO is achieved through continuous database replication, transaction log shipping, and regular backups

### Disaster Declaration Criteria

A disaster may be declared when:
1. Complete platform unavailability exceeding 15 minutes
2. Major data corruption affecting multiple users
