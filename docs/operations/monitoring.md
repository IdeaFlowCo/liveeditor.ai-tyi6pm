# Monitoring and Observability

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the monitoring and observability practices for the AI writing enhancement platform, covering metrics collection, logging strategies, distributed tracing, alerting, dashboards, and incident detection. The goal is to ensure reliability, performance, and security while providing insights into user behavior patterns.

## Monitoring Infrastructure
The monitoring infrastructure is designed to collect, process, and visualize data from various components of the platform. It uses a combination of tools and techniques to provide a holistic view of system health and performance.

### Metrics Collection Architecture
Metrics are collected from the client-side, API layer, services, and infrastructure components.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Client Side"
        A[Browser] --> B[Telemetry SDK]
        B --> C[Performance Events]
        B --> D[User Events]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Layer"
        E[API Gateway] --> F[Request Metrics]
        E --> G[Response Metrics]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Layer"
        H[Document Service] --> I[Document Metrics]
        J[AI Service] --> K[AI Processing Metrics]
        L[User Service] --> M[Auth Metrics]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        N[Database] --> O[Query Metrics]
        P[Cache] --> Q[Cache Metrics]

### Log Aggregation System
Structured logging is implemented with JSON format, correlation IDs, and PII protection.

| Component | Log Types | Retention | Aggregation Method |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Frontend | User actions, errors, performance | 14 days | Browser to backend batching |
| API Gateway | Request/response, security events | 30 days | Direct to centralized logging |
| Services | Application events, errors, warnings | 30 days | Structured logging to ELK |
| AI Integration | Request details, performance metrics | 14 days | Anonymized to central logging |

### Distributed Tracing Framework
Request tracing is implemented across services using correlation IDs and OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
