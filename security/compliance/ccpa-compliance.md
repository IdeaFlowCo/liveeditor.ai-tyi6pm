# CCPA Compliance Framework
> Document Version: 1.0
> Last Updated: 2023-11-15

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive framework implemented by our AI writing enhancement interface to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our platform is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of California residents while providing innovative AI-powered writing assistance.

The framework addresses key CCPA requirements including transparent privacy notices, implementation of consumer rights (access, deletion, opt-out), data inventory maintenance, service provider management, and employee training. We have adopted a privacy-by-design approach with particular attention to AI-specific privacy considerations, ensuring users maintain control over their personal information and document content.

This compliance framework is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect regulatory changes, platform enhancements, and evolving privacy best practices. All team members are responsible for understanding and implementing these compliance measures relevant to their roles.

## 1. CCPA Overview and Applicability

### 1.1 What is CCPA?

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California. Effective January 1, 2020, the CCPA gives California consumers several key rights regarding their personal information:

- The right to know what personal information is collected
- The right to know whether personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom
- The right to say no to the sale of personal information
- The right to access their personal information
- The right to request deletion of their personal information
- The right to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights

The CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that do business in California and meet certain thresholds.

### 1.2 Applicability to Our Platform

Our AI writing enhancement platform is subject to CCPA compliance because:

1. We operate as a for-profit entity
2. We collect personal information from California residents
3. We determine the purposes and means of processing personal information
4. We meet the applicable threshold criteria for businesses covered by CCPA

Our platform collects various types of personal information from users, including account details, document content, and usage analytics. We serve users across the United States, including California residents.

### 1.3 Key CCPA Requirements

The key CCPA requirements applicable to our platform include:

1. **Disclosure Requirements**: Providing notice at or before the point of collection about the categories of personal information collected and purposes for which it will be used.

2. **Privacy Policy Requirements**: Maintaining a comprehensive privacy policy that discloses specific information about our collection, use, and sharing of personal information.

3. **Consumer Rights**: Implementing mechanisms for consumers to exercise their rights to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale of their personal information.

4. **Verification Process**: Establishing a process to verify consumer requests.

5. **Non-Discrimination**: Ensuring that consumers who exercise their CCPA rights are not discriminated against.

6. **Data Security**: Implementing reasonable security measures to protect personal information.
