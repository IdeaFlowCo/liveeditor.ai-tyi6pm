# SOC 2 Controls Framework

## Introduction

This document outlines the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 framework implemented within the AI Writing Enhancement Platform. SOC 2 is an auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to assess the controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data.

Our platform is designed to achieve and maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance, which verifies not only that appropriate controls are in place (Type I) but also that they operate effectively over an extended period (typically 6-12 months). This commitment ensures that our handling of user documents and data meets rigorous security and privacy standards expected by professional users and enterprise customers.

This document serves as a central reference for:
- The SOC 2 trust principles applicable to our platform
- Specific controls implemented to meet these principles
- Roles and responsibilities for maintaining compliance
- Processes for monitoring, testing, and validating controls
- Documentation requirements for audit preparedness

## Trust Service Principles

The SOC 2 framework is built around five Trust Service Principles (TSPs). Our platform implements controls across all five principles, with particular emphasis on Security, Confidentiality, and Privacy due to the nature of our AI writing enhancement service.

### Security

**Definition**: The system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).

**Relevance to platform**: As a service processing potentially sensitive user documents and leveraging AI technologies, robust security controls are fundamental to protecting user content from unauthorized access or manipulation.

**Key focus areas**:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Infrastructure and network security
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Secure development practices
- Threat monitoring and vulnerability management

### Availability

**Definition**: The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.

**Relevance to platform**: Users rely on our platform for time-sensitive document improvements. System availability directly impacts user satisfaction and trust.

**Key focus areas**:
- Infrastructure redundancy and failover capabilities
- Capacity planning and monitoring
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Business continuity and disaster recovery planning
- Performance monitoring and incident response

### Processing Integrity

**Definition**: System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized.

**Relevance to platform**: Users depend on our AI suggestions to accurately improve their writing while preserving the original meaning and intent.

**Key focus areas**:
- Data input validation
- AI processing quality control
- Error handling and monitoring
- Version control and change management
- System monitoring and alerting

### Confidentiality

**Definition**: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.

**Relevance to platform**: User documents may contain proprietary or sensitive information that requires protection throughout the processing lifecycle.

**Key focus areas**:
- Data classification and handling
- Encryption of confidential information
- Access control to confidential data
- Secure deletion and retention policies
- Third-party data sharing controls

### Privacy

**Definition**: Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in compliance with organizational commitments and regulatory requirements.

**Relevance to platform**: User profiles and document metadata may contain personal information subject to privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

**Key focus areas**:
- Privacy notice and consent mechanisms
- Data minimization principles
- User rights management (access, correction, deletion)
- Data retention and disposal
- Cross-border data transfer controls

## Control Framework

Our SOC 2 control framework employs a structured approach to organizing and implementing controls. Each control is categorized and numbered for clear traceability during audits and internal assessments.

### Control Numbering System

Controls are identified using the following format:
```
TSP-CAT-###
```

Where:
- **TSP**: Trust Service Principle (SEC, AVA, PIN, CON, PRI)
- **CAT**: Control Category (see below)
- **###**: Sequential number within the category

### Control Categories

1. **GOV**: Governance Controls
2. **IAM**: Identity and Access Management
3. **CHG**: Change Management
4. **OPS**: Operations Management
5. **RKM**: Risk Management
6. **TPM**: Third-Party Management
7. **INC**: Incident Management
8. **DAT**: Data Management
9. **COM**: Communication and Training
10. **MON**: Monitoring and Testing

### Control Documentation

Each control is documented with the following information:
- Control ID and Name
- Control Description
- Implementation Details
- Responsible Roles
- Testing Frequency and Method
- Evidence Requirements
- Related Controls
