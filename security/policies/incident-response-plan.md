## Document Control
- **Owner:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Review Frequency:** Annual or after significant incidents
- **Security Policy Reference:** This plan operates under the organization's Security Policy Framework. For full details, refer to security-policy.md

## 1. Introduction

The AI Writing Enhancement Platform provides critical services to content creators, students, professionals, casual writers, editors, and educational institutions. This Incident Response Plan establishes a structured approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from incidents that may affect the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of the platform and its data.

### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives

This plan aims to:
- Establish clear procedures for incident detection, classification, and response
- Define roles and responsibilities within the incident response team
- Ensure timely and effective communication during incidents
- Minimize the impact of incidents on users and business operations
- Facilitate rapid recovery from incidents
- Provide a framework for learning from incidents and preventing recurrence

### 1.2 Scope

This plan applies to all incidents affecting the AI Writing Enhancement Platform, including but not limited to:
- Service outages and performance degradation
- Security breaches and vulnerabilities
- Data loss or corruption
- External dependency failures (e.g., OpenAI API)
- Infrastructure and networking issues

### 1.3 Plan Activation

This plan is activated when an incident is detected through monitoring alerts, user reports, or staff observations. The severity level of the incident determines the response procedures and escalation paths.

## 2. Incident Response Team

### 2.1 Team Structure

The Incident Response Team is structured to provide comprehensive coverage and clear lines of responsibility during incidents:

| Role | Primary Responsibility |

| Engineering Manager | Escalation point for technical issues |
| Operations Manager | Coordinates cross-functional response |
| Security Lead | Handles security-related incidents |
| Communications Lead | Manages internal and external communications |
| CTO | Final escalation point for major incidents |

### 2.2 Incident Commander Role

The Incident Commander is appointed from the response team at the beginning of each incident and has overall responsibility for:

- Establishing and maintaining command of the incident response
- Coordinating the activities of the response team
- Making critical decisions during the incident
- Ensuring all stakeholders are appropriately informed
- Declaring incident resolution and initiating post-incident activities

The Incident Commander has the authority to:
- Allocate resources as needed for incident response

## 3. Incident Classification

### 3.1 Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into four severity levels, determining response times and escalation paths:

| Level | Description | Response Time | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| P1    | Critical: Service outage, security breach | 15 minutes | Complete platform unavailability, data breach |
| P2    | High: Degraded performance, elevated errors | 30 minutes | AI service unresponsive, high error rates |
| P3    | Medium: Minor functionality issues | 4 hours | Non-critical feature unavailable, intermittent errors |
| P4    | Low: Non-impacting anomalies | 24 hours | Cosmetic issues, minor performance anomalies |

### 3.2 Incident Types

The platform may experience various types of incidents, including:

#### Availability Incidents
- Complete service outage
- Partial service degradation

- Criticality of affected features to users
- Duration of impact

#### Business Impact
- Revenue implications
- Reputational damage
- Regulatory compliance concerns
- Contract or SLA violations

#### Technical Impact
